# first-express-server

### During this practice we developed another approachement to the send information to the user, this time through the backend, thanks to Node.js and Express.js. So we just deploy a server on the localhost, on the port 3000. And we create three diferent answers to the routing. We create a main site that shows a Hello World. If we write on our routing /about, then we send send information about us, finally /contact for showing to the user a site where he could find contact information.

### For running the code your just need to clone the repository, run the command npm i on the console, and then once that done, run node server.js. Then you can go to your browser and write localhost:3000 on the search bar.
